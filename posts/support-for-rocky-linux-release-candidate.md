#### Announcing support for Rocky Linux 8.3 Release Candidate

> Rocky Linux is a community enterprise operating system designed to be 100% bug-for-bug compatible with America's top enterprise Linux distribution now that its downstream partner has shifted direction. It is under intensive development by the community. Rocky Linux is led by Gregory Kurtzer, founder of the CentOS project. Release Candidate 1 is now available for testing. Contributors are asked to reach out using the communication options offered on this site.

Rocky Linux released their first release candidate earlier today, and we're excited to announce that it is now a supported distribution to deploy on aarch64.com!

Not that it is a *release candidate*, not a stable production release, so it is intended to be used for testing only.
