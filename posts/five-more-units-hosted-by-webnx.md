We are thrilled to announce we have five more AArch64 #units available to host projects from the FOSS community. This is only possible because the wonderful team at [WebNX](http://www.webnx.com/) is sponsoring the hardware colocation at their Ogden, Utah data centre. WebNX also kindly supports us with BGP connectivity.
  
With the new five units live and ready, our number of 1U Lenovo ThinkSystem HR330A eMAG servers available to benefit the Free and Open-Source community has increased to fifteen. We will put more hardware in the service of the community as we get more colocation sponsorships. If you are interested in sponsoring us, please reach out using the contact options on our [Contact Us](https://aarch64.com/contact) page. We would love to hear from you!
  
The hardware specifications for each unit are:
- CPU: 1x Ampere eMAG CPU, 32x ARMv8 64-bit CPU cores at 3.3 GHz with Turbo
- RAM: 128GB, 2400MHz DDR4 RDIMM
- Disk Space: 480GB SSD
  
Our team would love to provide more disk space for each unit. Sadly, we currently have some constraints regarding SSDs. If you're a company or an individual and want to help us have more disk space for the FOSS community projects, please refer to our [Contact Us](https://aarch64.com/contact) page to reach us.
