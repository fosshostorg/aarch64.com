#### Arm-64.com is a daily blog, run by the technical folks from the [Fosshost](https://fosshost.org) project, intended to give you a real insight into the world of ARM computing. Share our journey of how we plan, manage, coordinate, and deploy a hyperscale ARMv8 distributed cloud computing platform in more than six global locations.

Hello, open-source community.

During the coming months, we will share our experiences (good and bad) of deploying
ARMv8 hardware into the data center. Images, videos and talks will be included to
give you a more immersive experience.
We hope you will enjoy this journey. The coming weeks and months will be extremely
exciting.

With this project, we intend to bring ARM to the data center and create an open
ecosystem that will give the open-source community a real competitive advantage.
Our ARM platform will launch in Canada, Europe, UK and USA. This is only possible
thanks to our very kind sponsors. They are:
