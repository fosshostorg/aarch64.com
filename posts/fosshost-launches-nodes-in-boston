Fosshost is delighted to announce that we have commited to a three year term with Lightwave Networks, Inc.  The partnership will consist of a three year colocation term to host 10u.

Lightwave Networks have provided Fosshost with non-profit pricing to support our mission and objectives of supporting, promoting and advancing the open source community with AArch64 hosting.

Deputy Technical Director at Fosshost, Hampton Moore, said "Working with LightWave Networks to deploy an aarch64 cluster in Boston gives Fosshost it's first presence on the US East, a previously untouched region. By being in Boston we will have sub 7ms connectivity to New York, and sub 14ms to Virginia. LightWave's Tier 3 data-center provides us with strong physical security, power and cooling redundancy, and good connectivity due to LightWave's connectivity to over 40 digital realty-owned data-centers, accounting for over 1,000 connected networks, whose connection we benefit from."
