Our platform is in the process of being independently reviewed by a cloud performance expert. The analysis will be valuable to assess the state of AArch64 and what can be improved so our tenants have the best possible VMs at their disposal.

As soon as the performance review is finalised, we'll publish a blog post about it, authored by the independent party doing the review. Keep an eye on our blog and Twitter account to read it as soon as it's published.
