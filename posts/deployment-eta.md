As you already [know](https://aarch64.com/post/one-step-closer-to-deploying-arm-units), the first batch of Arm-based hardware is shipping to us. The units are currently crossing the Atlantic Ocean, and we expect to have them in our possession in about a week. After receiving them, we will deploy the hardware to the data centers, a task predicted to take up to 2 weeks.
