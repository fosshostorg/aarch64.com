On Friday 16th, Thomas finished setting up 5 [1U Lenovo ThinkSystem HR330A eMAG](https://aarch64.com/post/overview-of-donated-hardware) units at the CustodianDC data center, with Nate assisting remotely. The hardware is now working and part of our AArch64 cluster.

Some projects, like [Armbian](https://armbian.com), [Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org/) and [Ubuntu Unity](https://ubuntuunity.org/), are already using our hardware. As we increase the number of units in production, the number of projects making use of them will grow.

Together, we will make Arm-based hardware and software first-class citizens in the open-source community, and the data center.
