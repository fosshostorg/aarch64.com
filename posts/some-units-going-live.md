Quoting Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth, from Futurama: «Good news, everyone». We are very pleased to announce that we will have some donated Arm-based units operational in the next 4 weeks. This means that the 9 applications currently in our backlog will start getting access to the hardware in a phased manner.

This donation comes from Ampere Computing, one of our sponsors. Ampere Computing is one of the leading forces for Arm-based hardware in the open-source ecosystem. This month, the company will be doing 10 donations to computer architecture research teams. You can learn more about it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AmpereComputing/status/1369342231761543180).
