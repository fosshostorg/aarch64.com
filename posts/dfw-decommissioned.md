On the first days of December, we began decommissioning our DFW PoP. We had several requests from our tenants for a more diverse geographical presence, and we listened.

To do it, we had to end our partnership with Equinix, to whom we are indeed grateful for the sponsorship since our early days, and went with another vendor. You can read all the details over at the [Fosshost blog](https://fosshost.org/news/diversifying-geographical-presence).

Decommissioning the DFW PoP meant a significant and coordinated team effort had to be made, so our team put the sleeves up and began the ongoing hard work. To minimize the impact on the affected tenants and facilitate a smooth transaction, we temporarily doubled the allocated resources.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this migration, you can reach us via our chat channels (irc.libera.chat/#fosshost and discord.gg/foss).
