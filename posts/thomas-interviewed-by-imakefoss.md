#### Thomas Markey gives interview to IMakeFOSS, giving a voice to FOSS projects around the world. Every week we hand the mic to a new contributor.

During their presentation they covered the background of the Fosshost Project, the leadership team who founded the project, mission statement and the types of projects that Fosshost has been helping.

IMakeFOSS - We give a voice to opensource projects around the world. Every week we hand the mic to a new FOSS contributor. @imakefoss is a Twitter rotation curation account, @imakefoss is a Mastodon rotation curation account, an interview blog and a YouTube channel.  Co-founded by Jason Evangelho and Jochen Spang.

IMakeFOSS is a rotation curation account similar to the @realscientists where people who contribute to FOSS can introduce themselves on a weekly basis. The idea is that those who are intensively involved with FOSS can present their projects and their person, answer questions and thus arouse interest in getting involved. At the same time we release a blog post here. The @imakefoss week starts and ends on a Wednesday.
