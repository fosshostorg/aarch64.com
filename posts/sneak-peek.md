Our work to deploy the first batch of Arm-based units continues to spear ahead. Although there is still a lot to do, we are close to being ready to make the first units available to already approved projects.

In the meantime, we share with you two screenshots from our Dashboard, provided by our CTO, Nate Sales. Here, projects will be able to self-manage their existing resources and request new ones.
