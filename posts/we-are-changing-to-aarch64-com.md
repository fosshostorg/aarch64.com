We have decided to bring the Fosshost Project site in-line with other ARM-focussed open source efforts, which is why with immediete effect, we've changed our name and domain before our
first Arm-based compute platform goes live.  

We're working with Arm and they gave us the domain 'aarch64.com' and helped us design the new logo, which we love.

Thomas Markey, Founder of Fosshost said, "This partnership with Arm will enable our work to go further, ensuring we can remain sustainable and to continue providing our services to the open source community.  The AArch64.com domain is a perfect domain name for us to enjoy as we build the momentum, and insight into the data centre using ARM-based hardware, kindly donated by Ampere Computing."
