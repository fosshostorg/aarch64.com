We are so happy to announce we will have eight units of our Arm-based hardware collocated with [Netwise](https://www.netwise.co.uk/) in London. The hardware will be located at Netwise's [London Central](https://www.netwise.co.uk/data-centres/london-central/) data center.

In twelve months,  we will relocate the units to Netwise's new data center, [London East](https://www.netwise.co.uk/data-centres/london-east/), opening this year. You can keep up with the news about Netwise new data center on their [blog](https://blog.netwise.co.uk/category/build-blog/).

This colocation was made under a 3 year contract, with lower costs due to Fosshost's non-profit status.

The hardware is expected to be ready ready to serve the FOSS community around the 9th of July 2021. With this new collocation, our Arm-based fleet increases to 18 units.
