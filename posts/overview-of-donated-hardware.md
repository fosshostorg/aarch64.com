#### AArch64.com is a daily blog, run by the technical folks from the [Fosshost](https://fosshost.org) project, intended to give you a real insight into the world of Arm computing. Share our journey of how we plan, manage, coordinate, and deploy a hyperscale Armv8 distributed cloud computing platform in more than six global locations.

Since our blog launched, many of you have been asking for details on exactly what hardware has been donated to AArch64.com project.

Ampere Computing have made a donation of 50 units of 1U Lenovo ThinkSystem HR330A eMAG systems.  These are being shipped directly from their Santa Clara, California Head Office. Memory and storage is still being defined. You can find a product sheet <a href="https://amperecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lenovo_ThinkSystem_HR330A_PB_20190409.pdf">here</a>.

An additional batch of 5 Arm-based units was donated by Equinix Metal.

We are working with the shipping and logistics team at Ampere Computing to get videos and images for the ready once the hardware starts to ship to our global locations.  This is now likely to start in the New Year!
