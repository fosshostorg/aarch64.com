#### Welcome to our fifth post in a series of blog posts about our incredible sponsors

Today's featured [sponsor](https://aarch64.com/sponsors) is [Ampere Computing](https://amperecomputing.com). The company was founded in 2018 by Renee James and has designed the industryâ€™s first cloud-optimized, Arm-based, microprocessor architecture.

The hardware designed by Ampere Computing is intended to set the new standard for cloud and edge computing. They do so by delivering superb performance, scalability, security, and power efficiency.

Ampere Computing is sponsoring us with the donation of 50 Arm-based 1U Lenovo ThinkSystem HR330A eMAG systems. You can find a product sheet with the hardware specifications [here](https://amperecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lenovo_ThinkSystem_HR330A_PB_20190409.pdf).

Peter Pouliot was providential in this sponsorship. To him and everyone at Ampere Computing, our deepest thanks for the sponsorship and for believing in our project.
