We are so happy to announce we will have ten units of our Arm-based hardware collocated with [Netwise](https://www.netwise.co.uk/) in London. The hardware will be located at Netwise's [London Central](https://www.netwise.co.uk/data-centres/london-central/) data center.

We expect to have the hardware ready to serve the FOSS community around the 9th of July 2021. With this new collocation, our Arm-based fleet increases to 20 units.
