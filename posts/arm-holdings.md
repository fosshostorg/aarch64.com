In our endeavour to give an edge to the open-source community in the ARM world with the ARM-64 project, we have gathered many sponsors, interest from projects and volunteers. This is allowing us to advance our project and, hopefully soon, provide ARM-as-Service to the FOSS community.

The advancements with our project have sparked the interest of ARM Holdings, with whom we have an informal meeting scheduled to discuss a closer relationship. We hope we can bring ties closer, which will allow us to benefit the open-source community through this relationship.
