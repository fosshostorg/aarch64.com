As we continue to write about our journey into the Arm, we decided we wanted an easier way to get feedback from our readers. To that end, we now have a comments section in every blog post, so you can leave your feedback. This change has the upside of helping create a friendly community around our blog.
  
Please take the opportunity to [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fosshostorg) and share this web page with educational groups, Arm fans, and like-minded individuals.
