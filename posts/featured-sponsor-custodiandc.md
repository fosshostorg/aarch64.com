#### Welcome to our second post in a series of blog posts about our incredible sponsors

Like many of you, today Jan, 4th 2021 was the start of a new business year.  Many of us will have either finished, or are only starting our day.

Equally - a critical day for arm-64.com as we continue to plan, coordinate and manage our fleet of 50units of ARM hardware.

Todays post will be regarding CustodianDC [sponsor](https://arm-64.com/sponsors), a Tier III+ colocation data center based in Montreal, Canada, and one of the leading choices for per unit and cabinet server colocation in the country.

HiveDC features, among many things, a 99% green data center and an uptime of 100%. In 2019, they won the Data Center Location of the Year Award.

Two of our fifty 1U Lenovo ThinkSystem HR330A eMAG systems will be colocated at HiveDC's data center, thanks to their sponsorship. This will allow us to provide ARM64-as-Service for open-source projects in more regions across the globe.

One of the company's co-founders, Karl Morin, was essential in providing sponsorship for the Arm-64 project. To him and everyone at HiveDC, thank you so much for all the kindness demonstrated toward us.
