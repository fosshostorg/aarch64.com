#### Arm-64.com is a daily blog, run by the technical folks from the [Fosshost](https://fosshost.org) project, intended to give you a real insight into the world of ARM computing. Share our journey of how we plan, manage, coordinate, and deploy a hyperscale ARMv8 distributed cloud computing platform in more than six global locations.

We wanted to make it easy for you guys to be able to access our ARM64-as-a-service so we took the decision to add this into our application form.

We are officially taking pre-applications for the service and build requests, will be processed in the order in which they were received.

We make it easy to apply for ARM hosting but it is mandatory that you read our Eligibility Criteria before applying, to ensure that you are a good fit! Ensuring you understand our criteria before applying, will save your time and disappointment if not approved.
