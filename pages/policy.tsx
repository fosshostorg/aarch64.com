        We may use images of ARM, our sponsors, partners, vendors, third party
        organisations or suppliers as part of the overall experience to show a
        real, behind the scenes view of our project and the progress we make
        during our journey. The use of images does not always constitute
        acceptance of any relationship. We do not advertise, promote or condone
        any logo or image throughout this website, and neither can we be
        responsible for your curiosity or self determination, if you decide that
        you may wish to independently contact these organisations. Do so at your
        own risk, we are not responsible for your actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do have sponsors who provide colocation facilities, not but limited
        to rack space, power, connectivity, cooling, security and associated
        services. We list sponsors on our website as those who help colocate
        fosshost / ARM64 hardware. We have agreements with all of our sponsors
        that outline the terms of the service they provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        In return, we will list them on our website as a hosting sponsor. These
        listings may generate positive PR opportunities and create sales for our
        sponsors. We are not liable, responsible, or interested in such matters,
        since these are the individual actions of our website visitors. We do
        not mediate or receive any commission or financial compensation for the
        actions of our website visitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sponsors may, at their sole discretion, provide further sponsorship
        opportunities, if our website visitors decide to transact with our
        sponsors. These sponsorship opportunities would effectively be in the
        form of additional rack space. There is no cash equivalent.
